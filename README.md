# **Explainable AI for Healthcar**

This repository contains the implementation of Explainable AI for Healthcare, a system developed as part of an MSc Computer Science dissertation. The project integrates Machine Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), and an interactive Streamlit-based web interface to predict multiple diseases—Heart Disease, Diabetes, and General Illness—while providing human-interpretable explanations using SHAP.

## **Overview**

This project implements a complete Explainable AI (XAI)-based Healthcare System capable of predicting:

❤️ Heart Disease

🩸 Diabetes

🤒 General Illness

📊 BMI Analysis

Unlike traditional black-box ML models, this system provides transparent explanations using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to help users understand why the model predicted a certain result.

## **Features**
**1.Disease Prediction**

- Heart Disease 
- Diabetes Prediction 
- Multi-disease symptom classification 

**2.Explainable AI Integration**

- SHAP Summary Plot
- SHAP Force Plot
- SHAP Waterfall Plot
- Textual explanation panel

**3.Streamlit UI**

- Modern, clean & responsive
- Real-time predictions
- Visual analytics (charts, donut plots, bar plots)

**4.Modules**

- Heart Disease Prediction
- Diabetes Analysis
- General Illness Prediction
- BMI Calculator

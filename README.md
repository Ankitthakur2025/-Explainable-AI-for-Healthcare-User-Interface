# Explainable AI for Healthcar

This repository contains the implementation of Explainable AI for Healthcare, a system developed as part of an MSc Computer Science dissertation. The project integrates Machine Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), and an interactive Streamlit-based web interface to predict multiple diseases—Heart Disease, Diabetes, and General Illness—while providing human-interpretable explanations using SHAP.
